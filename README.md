# proof-of-work
Blockchain with proof-of-work

A JavaScript implementation of a blockchain system featuring a proof of work consensus mechanism. This project demonstrates core blockchain concepts including mining, transaction processing, and chain validation.

Features

1. Proof of Work Mining: Implements the core consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
2. Transaction Management: Includes a memory pool (mempool) for pending transactions
3. Block Structure: Properly structured blocks with timestamps, previous hash references, and Merkle roots
4. Mining Rewards: Includes coinbase transactions as mining incentives
5. Chain Validation: Functionality to verify the integrity of the entire blockchain

Core Components

1. Block mining with adjustable difficulty
2. Transaction queue management
3. Genesis block initialization
4. Chain validation mechanisms
5. Merkle tree implementation for transaction verification
